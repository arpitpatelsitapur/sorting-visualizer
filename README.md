# Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool

A web-based application to visualize and understand sorting algorithms interactively. This tool demonstrates step-by-step sorting with animations and insights, making it a great resource for learning and teaching.

| Sorting Algorithm     | Working                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort           | Compare `two adjacent` elements and `swap` accordingly |
| Selection Sort        | Select the `smallest` element and `place it in order` |
| Insertion Sort        | Insert elements into the sorted part one by one |
| Merge Sort            | Divide the array and merge sorted subarrays   |
| Quick Sort            | Partition array around a `pivot` element       |
| Heap Sort             | Build a `heap` and extract max/min repeatedly  |
| Radix Sort            | Sort elements `digit by digit` using `place values` |
| Bucket Sort           | Divide elements into buckets and `sort each bucket` |
| Shell Sort            | Sort using gaps and reduce them progressively |
| Counting Sort         | Count elements and place them in sorted order |

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms like ****Bubble Sort**** with step-by-step animations.

- Real-time updates and comparison tracking.

- Customizable settings, including color schemes and array configurations.

- Intuitive user interface powered by ****Streamlit****.

  

## Technologies Used

- ****Python****: Core programming language.

- ****Streamlit****: For creating the interactive web interface.

- ****Altair****: For generating charts and visualizations.

- ****NumPy****: For numerical computations.

- ****Pandas****: For data manipulation and processing.

  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/arpitpatelsitapur/sorting-visualizer.git
```
```bash
cd "sorting-visualizer"
```
  

2.  Install the required dependencies:

  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  

  

3.  Run the application:

  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
  

  

  

## **How to Use**

1.  Launch the app using the command above.

2.  Select a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) from the dropdown menu.

3.  Customize settings such as the array size or visualization color scheme.

4.  Press “Play” to watch the algorithm sort the array step by step.

  

## **Future Enhancements**

•  Implement time complexity analysis for each step.

•  Support user-uploaded datasets for sorting.

•  Enhance visualizations with additional animations and interactivity.
